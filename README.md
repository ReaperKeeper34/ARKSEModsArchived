# ARKSEModsArchived

Yeah this is what i could find of my old Ark Modding stuff,

I had some help from ISpeZZ for the color changes, and i think a bit of the ranged attacks from LeutianKane.

other then that the rest is my code, im not sure how well the files will play with the ADK as they are from a 2017 build of it. 

That being said, good luck, if you have questions you can shoot me a message on discord Azazel#8008. Though i wont lie, i havent touched any of the ADK since 2017.

Enjoy.
